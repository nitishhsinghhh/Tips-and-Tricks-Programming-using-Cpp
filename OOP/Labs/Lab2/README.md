# Practical Lab Assignment - Control Structures - if/else
This GitHub repository contains a set of C++ programs that can be used to perform common operations such as temperature conversion, swapping of two numbers without using a third variable, finding the greatest number among three numbers, checking if a given year is a leap year or not, and checking if a given number is even or odd.

## List of Programs
|#| **Title** | **Comment** |
|---| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|1| [**Temperature**](https://github.com/nitishhsinghhh/Tips-and-Tricks-Programming-using-Cpp/blob/main/OOP/Lab2/Temperature.cpp) | This C++ program calculates temperature from degree centigrade to Fahrenheit |
|2| [**Swap values**](https://github.com/nitishhsinghhh/Tips-and-Tricks-Programming-using-Cpp/blob/main/OOP/Lab2/Swapping.cpp) | This C++ program is used to swap of two noâ€™s without using third variable |
|3| [**Greatest of 3 hours**](https://github.com/nitishhsinghhh/Tips-and-Tricks-Programming-using-Cpp/blob/main/OOP/Lab2/Greatestnumber.cpp) | This C++ program calculates greatest in 3 numbers|
|4| [**Leap year**](https://github.com/nitishhsinghhh/Tips-and-Tricks-Programming-using-Cpp/blob/main/OOP/Lab2/LeapYear.cpp) | This C++ program calculates entered year is leap year or not |
|5| [**Even number or not**](https://github.com/nitishhsinghhh/Tips-and-Tricks-Programming-using-Cpp/blob/main/OOP/Lab2/OddEven.cpp) | This C++ program calculates given no is even or odd. |

## How to Use
To use these programs, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. You can then download the program files from this repository and compile them using the compiler.

Alternatively, you can also use an online C++ compiler to run these programs without needing to install a compiler on your computer.
